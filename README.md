# FriendFinder
## What is this?
This Node application that provides the user with a survey and then matches them with a friend who had answers to the survey most similar to the user.

## How to get started
To use this app, the user first clicks on "Go to Survey" leading them to the survey page. Then the user fills out the survey by providing their name and a profile image link and answering from 1 to 5 the 10 questions shown. When complete, the user then clicks on submit and the app then calculates their compatability with the stored list of possible friends. When it has found a suitable match, a popup will appear with that person's name and image.
